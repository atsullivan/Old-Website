        <p>Dear Hilary, Happy Valentine’s Day!  I am really hoping that we get to talk sometime this morning.  I hope that your day is going well so far.  I was thinking the other day, we haven’t sent each other letters even once this semester.  That is just tragic.  Although I couldn’t get one in the mail to you in time for today, I thought this would be the next best thing.</p>

        <p>It is crazy to think about how far we have come.  I remember us celebrating Valentine’s last year.  A year later and we are engaged, almost graduating.  I just got off of Skype with you.  We had some hard conversations and I think us being apart has really gotten to the both of us.  I just can’t wait to see you again.  </p>

        <p>I honestly can’t think of much to say.  I have just been missing you so much lately.  This semester feels like it is never going to end.  I spend a lot of time reminiscing back on all of the times we have spent together.  This past Christmas break flew by.  My favorite day together was when we sat on the couch together some random morning in your living room and just talked and joked around and laughed for a couple hours.  I don’t even remember what we talked about, other than that Disneyland conversation where I waved my arms around and you thought that that was just the funniest thing, haha.  I can picture you laughing right now.</p>

        <p>That’s one of the things that I miss most about you, is hearing that laugh.  Any time that I can get you to laugh melts my heart. </p> 

        <p>I miss you so much Hilpup, but all I can really say is that I am so thankful for you.  I thank God that He has allowed us to be together every day of my life.  I am honestly the luckiest man in the world to be able to look forward to marrying you.  </p>

        <p>Anyway, I miss you so much my love, and I can’t wait to talk to you again.  I love you more than words can describe.</p>

        <p>Love, Andrew</p>
